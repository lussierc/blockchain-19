# cs390f2021-project

## Running the Project

The program is implemented in Python and the use of Pip will be necessary to run the program in its current state. Ensure these are installed on your machine. In the future, we would look to use Docker or Pipenv to automate this process.

### Running the Blockchain19 Program

After ensuring that Python and Pip are installed on your machine, you may need to use Pip to install the necessary libraries to run the program:
```
pip install prettytable
pip install csv
pip install re
```

You can then navigate to the `src` directory by using the command `cd src`.

You can then run the program by using the command `python3 blockchain19.py`

### Running the Pytest Test Suite

First ensure `pytest` is installed on your machine. Run `pip install pytest` if  you do not have this installed.

Then from the main project directory, you can run the command `pytest tests` to run the test suite.
