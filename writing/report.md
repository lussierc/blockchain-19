## Introduction and Motivation

What is the concept behind your project? How does it satisfy the two broad requirements on this assignments? Discuss briefly
how your concept is motivated by the cryptocurrency-related technology and what existing or potential solutions might it provide to our challenges?

Throughout the last three weeks our class have had an in depth discussion about cryptocurrencies and how they function. The algorithm behind one of the biggest 
cyrptocurrencies (bitcoin) is known as blockchain. Blockchain was one of the main focus points in our class sessions as it is the key to creating and correcting the 
ledger that bitcoin runs on. This algorithm allows storage of the mining and transaction of bitcoin across the globe, a decentralized system that allows anyone to 
confirm and work with each other, while also keeping all individual parties anonymous. Blockchain is a great data way to store data and recall on those data points. 
With all that we had learned over the semester we knew that a blockchain data storage algorithm based program is what our group wanted to pursue. The only thing we 
needed to create our algorithm was data to store in it. We thought about this for a few days as the data is almost as important as the algorithm its being stored 
in. With all of the data and research with the current global pandemic, we wanted to use mock-up covid-19 hospital / patient data. This direction was realistic in 
the way that our algorithm could store important data for hospitals and researchers without giving away the identity of any patients. Patient confidentiality is 
important to the integrity of our healthcare system, which made blockchain storage a perfect fit for this realistic application. Here is where Blockchain-19 was 
started. 

## Design of your Project

This section should provide detailed description of your design. Please include a visual representation of the design of your project. This could include a technical diagram or a flowchart demonstrating how your concept works, a walk through a conceptual example, etc. 

Now that we had our idea set in stone we needed to hash out (pun intended) how we were going to design and move forward with the project. 

## Implementation

This section should describe implementation details of your project (how you implemented your solution). Please describe which languages, libraries, external tools you used. This section should also provide commands (in code blocks) that are needed to run your implementation and what is needed to be installed beforehand. 

## Evaluation and Testing

This section should concentrate on how you conducted evaluation of your solution. You should test your implementation with different inputs (at least ten, if it makes sense) to verify its correctness, efficiency, effectiveness, etc. as appropriate for your project. Please include the input and a sample output in code blocks or indicate where these inputs/outputs are located  (as appropriate given your implementation). Automated testing is preferred but manual testing is acceptable. You must describe the type of testing that have been done and include the output of test cases in code blocks if appropriate.

## Description of the challenges that you faced and how you resolved them

## If worked in a team, description of the way in which you and your team members shared the project work
