# Blockchain-19

## Add Your Name(s): Christian Lussier, Jordan Wilson, Ryan Hilty

## Description of the Concept:
Using extensive blockchain concepts to keep a detailed ledger of COVID-19 patient movement and statuses.

This project will expand upon the concepts conveyed via the Blockchain Game played in the CMPSC 390 class, but with a real-world twist as it will relate to COVID-19. The blockchain will will use in patient attributes such as the hospital they reside in, patient ID, and level of care as base inputs. It will then calculate the hash (using a variation of the hash function used in this game) of each patient based on these attributes and the previous hash in the blockchain. By using a blockchain with hash technology, patients can ensure that their private information is confidentially secured and that it won't be released.

## Relevance and Motivation of the Concept:

Throughout the last 10 months there has been an overlooking factor that has changed the course of our lives forever. COVID-19 has impacted the course of global history in a number of ways. One large portion of areas that have been affected are hospitals. Hospitals have been seeing an overwhelming amount of patience during the span of the pandemic. Much of these spikes were unexpected and unwarned, flooding hospitals with patients in quantities never seen before.

In our research with cryptocurrencies, we have run into an algorithm known commonly as blockchain. Blockchain is an algorithm that uses hash functions to keep records of data in a secure, non tamper fashion. Our team has thought of a way to keep hospital records while using implementations of blockchain. Using this our algorithm would be able to keep track of patients, what hospital they are in, the status of the patient, and much more while keeping all records of each patient confidential and secure. This would also benefit covid-19 research as there would be a ledger full of information regarding patients and how Covid-19 has affected them both mentally and physically. This fight for the pandemic seems to be never ending, small ideas like these are beneficial for all parties.

## Description of the Tasks to Complete:

- *Finalize the attributes of the blockchain:*
- *Do a run-through/manual run of our blockchain concept on a new ledger:*
- *Begin implementation of the hash solver in Python:*
- *Finalize and test accuracy of hash solver:*
- *Implement open ledger capabilities (allow users to enter their own entries into the blockchain, which are then converted using the hash solver):*
- *Implement feature allowing user to export/import their blockchain file using a CSV:*
